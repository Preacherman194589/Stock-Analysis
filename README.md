# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Steve ask that conduct an analysis on several stocks that are simliar to Green Stock and DAQO Stock. After present to him my workbook, he then asked if I could loop through the data in order to collect information to determine if refactoring or editing through VBA Script runs faster.

### Results 
After refactoring the codes and collected information from the Green Stocks, I changed the name to VB Challenge to have a better understanding of what data I needed to crete a workbook. I was then given a challenge, knowing the VBA Script and then handed a Challenge Starter Code. I refactored the starter code with VBA Script and complete the challenge and the displayed the Elapsed Time. I then collected Attached are two screenshots of my end time for 2017 and 2018 data sheets, I also included the code that was used to gather the information![image]![VB_Challenge_2017](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106892740/175195573-9ede55d3-cd9e-4a08-887b-9cdb1f973ab1.png)

## Summary

  **Detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general?**

The advantage in refactoring code, is seeing your work and understand what went wrong and how to correct the problem. The disadvantage is the time-consuming work and not understanding the problem unless you seek help on certain codes and formulating that code.

  **Detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script?**

The advantage I noticed if I’m answering the question correctly, I was able to recognize that the format of VBA did not have a lot of the variables in the original factored, ex: Print. It was easy to determine which variable is prevalent and which one is not. However, the disadvantage is not using debug or other methods to determine why you’re not getting the results you want. Some of the information or language in the original data was similar to the refactored but the variable might display a different name or data type.
